## About This Project

<br>

This is a project created by my team as our assignment submission for Software Engineering - Software Engineering Design 1.
The goal of this project was to produce an escape room/puzzle game utilising the GPT-3 API. The objective of the game is to
successfully complete tasks generated by the AI in a futuristic lab setting. Completing these tasks allows you to rebuild
the time machine to return to your original timeline. From memory games to science questions, Lost in Time attempts to
challenge players with every attempt.
